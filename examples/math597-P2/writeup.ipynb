We'll look at the algorithms and code to generate the necessary matrices and vectors. And finally, we'll do a convergance study of our implementation to check how well it converges.\n",

    "### Time Stepping\n",

    "Now that we have a global linear system, we will solve for the time derivative and then time step with a time stepping scheme. For CG, we use Algorithm 5.5 as a guide, and for DG we use 6.7 as a guide.\n",

    "Solving the CG global system yields:\n",

    "\\frac{\\partial q_J}{\\partial t} = (M_{IJ})^{-1}(\\tilde{D}_{IJ} f_J - F_{IJ} f_J^*)\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To time step, most schemes will work. We use a strong stability-preserving (SSP) RK3 method by Shu. For $\\frac{dq}{dt} = R(q)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",

    "\n",
    "The time stepping is designed as an abstract interface class that allows for expansion to other methods. It allows for a RHS function that takes $q^n$, a RHS matrix that multiplies $q^n$, or a vector already formed by the operation of $R(q)$. Each scheme allows for a suggested maximum time step, given a characteristic speed and characteristic length. This allows for an adaptive grid later on."

    "#### Element Mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "With the linear systems formed and a way to time step, we are ready to solve the problem at hand. The CG and DG versions are fairly similar. We first form the mesh made up of `Element1D`s. Each `Element1D` contains the reference element grid, a quadrature grid (with options for exact or inexact quadrature), the physical bounds, and storage for data matrices and vectors like the solution, flux, or other element matrices like mass or derivative matrices. The `Element1D` class has member functions for transforming from the local reference element to the global domain and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ElementMesh1D` class contains a `std::vector<Element1D>` that has the main storage for the mesh. It also has utility functions like `setInitialCondition` and `plot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these are implemented in `Element1D.hpp` and `Mesh1D.hpp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advance Routines\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk of the work is done in the `advanceCG` and `advanceDG` routines provided in `examples/math597-P2/main.cpp`. These routines roughly follow Algorithms 5.5 for CG and 6.7 for DG.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Element Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sanity check, when we run `advanceCG` or `advanceDG` with $N = 1$ and $N_e \\le 4$, the element matrices are printed out for us to compare with the derivations in the book. After debugging, we can run and observe that the element matrices and the global matrices via DSS are, in fact, correct for these parameters:"

The inexact quadrature results in purely diagonal matrices for mass and derivative matrices, both local and global, whereas the matrices formed from exact quadrature are block diagonal. I did not time or do anything to take advantage of the structure of these matrices (my linear algebra classes use a dense implementation and are wrappers around `LAPACK`). That being said, in future versions, I could take advantage of this structure to hopefully achieve some speedup.\n",

Even my code, which tends to be naive to larger applications, seems to have a flow to it. At least as the developer it seems that way! I'm looking forward to future development!"

    "We explored the 1D wave equation by solving it via CG and DG Galerkin methods. For both CG and DG, a linear system is formed first on the reference element, and then on the global domain. The solution is advanced in time via a SSB RK3 method. We looked at a convergence study and compared the CG and DG methods, with both exact and inexact integration."
