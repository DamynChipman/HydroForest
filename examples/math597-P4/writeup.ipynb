    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2D Grids, Elements, and Meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a 2D code, we need some tools to work on 2D grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `Grid2D.hpp`\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D tensor product grid is implemented with the `LobattoTensorProductGrid2D` class found in `Grid2D.hpp`. To construct a `LobattoTensorProductGrid2D`, we provide the order basis functions we want in the x- and y-directions. We can access the 1D versions which act as the foundation for the 2D version. In addition, there are utility functions for getting index sets for the points along a boundary or indexing into the grid with a single index or a pair of indices corresponding to an x or a y index.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `Element2D.hpp`\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D elements are implemented with the `QuadElement2D` class found in `Element2D.hpp`. Construction requires a set of points with the physical vertices of the element, and the desired basis function order in the x- and y-direction. Upon construction, the element computes and stores the element normals, the area, and Jacobian and metric terms. The Jacobian and metric terms are computed using Algorithm 12.1. The `QuadElement2D` class has utility functions for mapping between the reference and physical grids. As currently implemented, we *should* be able to work on an unstructured grid, though only rectangular elements have been tested. In addition, each element has a `std::map` of `Vector`s and `Matrix`s that can be used to store data on the element such as variable values at nodal points.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `Mesh2D.hpp`\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D mesh is implemented in the `ElementMesh2D` class found in `Mesh2D.hpp`. The `ElementMesh2D` class wraps some of the `p4est` functionality and stores the `p4est_t` object that is used with `p4est`. Currently, upon construction, `ElementMesh2D` creates a `p4est_t` object for a periodic, rectangular domain. Each of the `QuadElement2D` instances are stored in each of the `p4est_quadrant_t` objects. This way, we can use the functionality of `p4est` for iterating over volumes and faces, as well as future implementations with adaptivity and unstructured meshes. The `ElementMesh2D` class provides utility functions to iterate over elements, as well as set variables on each element, set solutions on each element, and output the mesh to a VTK PRectilinearGrid format. These files can be visualized with ParaView or VisIt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exact vs. Inexact Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of chapter 16, Giraldo shows Figure 16.3, which is a work-precision diagram for the exact and inexact integration approaches. This is also something we have experimented with in 1D in the other projects for this course. The time savings for the minimal difference in error demonstrates that the clear choice for implementation for a quick code is to use inexact integration. Plus, this simplifies many of the algorithms we need to implement as the nodal and quadrature points are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volume and Flux Integral Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's examine the matrices we need to form (or may not need to form...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Giraldo details how to form the element matrices $M_{ij}^{(e)}$, $F_{ijk}^{(e,l)}$, or $\\tilde{D}_{ij}^{(e)}$. This would allow us to perform the time update by forming the element matrices, multiplying by the associated variable vectors, then inverting the mass matrix to update $q_k$. This is precisely Algorithm 16.6. However, as Giraldo notes, this approach would only work for linear problems and static grids. Plus, it is terribly inefficient as each element must have not only the data vectors associated with the system of PDEs, but also each of the system matrices. Because of the static grid concern and for better efficiency, we'll try a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we define $R_{VOLUME}$ and $R_{FLUX}$ that represents the volume and flux integral contributions to the right-hand side. We can develop an algorithm to perform the action of $\\tilde{D}_{ij}^{(e)}$ or $F_{ijk}^{(e,l)}$ on the associated vector. This allows us to not store a system matrix and allows us to update each element, even if the mesh is adapted. As our intention is to implement this on an adaptive mesh, this is more optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms 16.7 and 16.8 detail how to form the volume and flux contributions with exact integration. Algorithms 16.9 and 16.10 detail how to form the volume and flux contributions with inexact integration. We implement Algorithms 16.9 and 16.10 below:"

For example, I have verified that the 2D utilities work as intended (the 2D basis function plots and other test cases show this). I also have verified that the mesh and the elements are being constructed properly, with the proper neighbor pattern and periodicity. The `p4est` utilities are helpful for proving that. In addition, though we don't use the system matrices, I have constructed the mass, derivative, and flux matrices for linear elements and checked them with the results in the textbook and they match. This proves to me that I am constructing `psi` and it's various flavors properly.\n",

While this project is currently due, I will continue working on this code base secondary to my dissertation work. My dissertation work is focused on solving elliptic PDEs on adaptive meshes. The equations in hydrodynamics would greatly benefit from a fast solver for the elliptic components such as the pressure field or mass diffusion. So, I foresee the chance to combine this code `HydroForest` with my dissertation code `EllipticForest`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Getting this case to actually work...\n",
    "- The ability to solve system of PDEs\n",
    "- Adaptive mesh capability\n",
    "    - `HydroForest` already wraps pieces of `p4est`, I just need to work on the 2-1 interfaces and fluxes\n",
    "- Unstructured mesh \n",
    "    - `p4est` has a Gmsh reader, and the `QuadElement2D` instances are stored in the `p4est` quadrants, so with little work, I should be able to create a Gmsh mesh file and create a mesh from that\n",
    "- Integrate with dissertation code for elliptic solvers: `EllipticForest`\n",
    "- Parallel implementation through `Petsc`\n",

    "In conclusion, we looked at the 2D conservation form of a system of PDEs and derived a solution methodology using a discontinuous Galerkin approach. We derived an update formula for integrating the solution over time. We detailed how to compute the matrices and vectors needed for the update. In addition, we looked at some of the implementation details and the motivation behind those details, such as exact vs. inexact integration and the form of the volume and flux contributions. The 2D utilities, algorithms, and code are also provided. We looked at the current buggy results and potential issues and fixes. Finally, we discussed the future potential of this code base."
