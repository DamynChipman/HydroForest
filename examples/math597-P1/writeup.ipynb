    "When working with a finite element method, the operations of interpolation, integration, and differentiation need to be quick, efficient, and practical. To accomodate this, we use polynomial basis functions and nodal basis points generated from polynomials. There is solid mathematical theory to motivate the use of polynomials (and special types of polynomials) for these kinds of operations.\n",

    "These kinds of polynomials have useful properties for our interpolation, integration, and differentiation operations. For example, they have a property called \"partition of unity\", which means that at each basis point, only one of the $N$ polynomials is equal to one, with all others equal to zero (you can check this at each point in the figure above). This is useful for integration via quadrature because it allows us to use quadrature weights for integration (more on that in problem 3).\n",

    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerically integrating a function over a set domain using a specific set of points is called a quadrature rule. Because of the properties of the polynomials we are using, we can integrate quite effectively using the quadrature weights generated from each polynomial and basis set. While this would work for Chebyshev points, and even uniform points with the right weights and weighting function, we will be looking at Legendre-Gauss and Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points.\n",

    "##### Legendre-Gauss Quadrature\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of an LG quadrature are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "w_i = \\frac{2}{(1 - x_i^2)(\\phi_N'(x_i))^2}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto Quadrature\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of an LGL quadrature are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "w_i = \\frac{2}{N(N+1)(\\phi_N(x_i))^2}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the weights, we can use them to interpolate a function as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "I = \\int_{-1}^{1} f_N(x) dx &= \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sum_{i=0}^N L_i(x) f_i dx \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{k=0}^{N} w_k \\Big( \\sum_{i=0}^N L_i(x) f_i \\Big)\n",

    "To implement this, the difference now is we use the basis points for both the sample and basis points when computing $L_{ik}$. This now gives a matrix to map nodal points to nodal points where the weights are also collocated. By summing up the product of the weights and the nodal function points, we get the value of the integral via Gaussian quadrature.\n",
